Mock interviews can give you some video interview experience, you can understand the shortcomings through the interview feedback. You can also observe from the interviewer's point of view and learn the problem solving skills of the best candidates. Second, mock interviews are also suitable for programmers who want to practice their English skills, communication skills, and stress tolerance, because you need to answer an algorithm problem in 40 minutes and need the other person to understand your solution.

Some countries they are not native English speakers, speaking ability is also very general, which helped me to practice English listening, but even if their English is poor, but will still speak confidently, do not care too much about grammar, this I think it is worthwhile for domestic job seekers to learn, because only to compare the English of other job seekers, you know their English is actually not so bad, can be more confident in the interview to express."),(0,i.kt)("ol",{start:2},(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol"},"Interviewer perspective")),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Mock interviews not only let you practice your problem solving and communication skills under pressure, but more importantly, let you judge what kind of job seekers are good from the interviewer's point of view.

And you will slowly find that an excellent job applicant is no matter what the interviewer will feel excellent, but poor there are various types of questions.
