A few days later, Shamos presented the problem and its history at a Carnegie Mellon University seminar, only to have Jay Kadane, a statistician in attendance, outline Algorithm 4 (note: the dynamic programming solution) in less than a minute. The good thing is that we know there will be no faster algorithm: any correct algorithm must take at least O(n) time"\nMichael Shamos, a mathematician, spent an all-nighter to devise the partitioning solution.

Rather, I am saying that the optimal solution to certain problems is very difficult to come up with, and it is important to understand these facts so that you can assess your level more accurately and not feel sorry for yourself because it took you an hour to come up with the optimal solution. In addition, if you are influenced by the difficulty label of a question, overestimating or underestimating your true level will not help you in the interview, so I now use the Leetcode invisible plugin that I developed to hide the difficulty of the question. I suggest that Leetcode should be graded according to Google Kickstart, so that a question can be divided into two difficulty labels and two test sets, for example, the maximum suborder and the label of this question is Easy | Hard, which means that the suboptimal solution is easier, but the optimal solution requires some ingenuity to solve."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,'Practice makes perfect\nI have done about 900 questions in Leetcode, and once I am familiar with the pattern of the questions, I can deduce the solution just from the name of the question.
