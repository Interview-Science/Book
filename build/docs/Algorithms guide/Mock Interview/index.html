mock interviews on Pramp, a free platform for programmer mock interviews that matches you with a suitable programmer based on your pre-selected programming language and availability. For an hour and a half, you take turns being the interviewer for an algorithm or system design question in terms of problem solving, coding, and communication.</p><p>Who needs mock interviews
Mock interviews are first of all suitable for programmers seeking jobs in large overseas companies, because the interview process and scope of large overseas companies are relatively standardized, and the content of the examination is usually one of the two: algorithm and system design. Mock interviews can give you some video interview experience, you can understand the shortcomings through the interview feedback. You can also observe from the interviewer&#x27;s point of view and learn the problem solving skills of the best candidates. Second, mock interviews are also suitable for programmers who want to practice their English skills, communication skills, and stress tolerance, because you need to answer an algorithm problem in 40 minutes and need the other person to understand your solution. I have conducted over 40 mock interviews on Pramp in the past year or so. (I&#x27;ve already done all the algorithm questions in there, so the platform can&#x27;t schedule new ones for me at the moment.</p><p>Interview process
What I learned from the mock interviews
Communication skills
During the mock interview process, I met a lot of candidates from different countries and backgrounds. From familiar countries like the US, India, France, Germany, etc. to Kazakhstan, Turkey and some other countries I didn&#x27;t know. Some countries they are not native English speakers, speaking ability is also very general, which helped me to practice English listening, but even if their English is poor, but will still speak confidently, do not care too much about grammar, this I think it is worthwhile for domestic job seekers to learn, because only to compare the English of other job seekers, you know their English is actually not so bad, can be more confident in the interview to express.</p><ol start="2"><li>Interviewer perspective</li></ol><p>Mock interviews not only let you practice your problem solving and communication skills under pressure, but more importantly, let you judge what kind of job seekers are good from the interviewer&#x27;s point of view. As an interviewer, you will know in advance to examine each other which question, usually this question you have done before, for example, you have done in previous interviews two sum this question, then as an interviewer when the system will arrange you to test this question, so the advantage is that you can be from the other side of the process of solving the question, reflecting on their own in solving this question where not good enough. And you will slowly find that an excellent job applicant is no matter what the interviewer will feel excellent, but poor there are various types of questions. I have encountered a question can quickly answer and can give three solutions, have encountered look at the topic directly after giving up, but also encountered to do the timeout or not give up. You will find that even if the two applicants are not bug free, but you may give them a very different evaluation. So in addition to solving the problem, how to highlight their own highlights in the interview process, and other job seekers to distinguish themselves is very important. In the following, I summarized some of the best job seekers I learned to solve the problem techniques, I hope it can help you:.</p><p>2.1 Understand the topic</p><p>You can never answer a question you do not understand, if you think the question you probably understand, then in fact you do not understand. Some of the questions on Pramp are very long and take a few minutes to read through. When I first started the simulation, I wanted to read through the questions quickly and start directly, because the interviewer was looking at the camera, and if it took too long, I was worried that they would question my English reading ability, and it would be awkward for everyone if he/she was watching me read the questions. However, after a few times, I found that it was easy to ignore the key words such as sorted or positive, which are very important to solve the problem. I have met some read the topic directly after writing code candidates, but halfway through the writing found but the ideas and ideas wrong, I did not even have the opportunity to help him / her, because he / she did not tell me his thoughts before writing the code, I also do not know what he / she was thinking</p><p>Take notes while reading the topic
Record key points.
Recursion reducing (dividing) the length of the line segments drawn at each stage by âˆš2.
Write a function drawHTree((x, y), length, depth) to constructs an H-tree
Use the drawLine function as helper function
2.2 Step by step</p><p>Even if it is a difficult problem, when you know what data structure to use and have the right idea to solve it, most of you can write the code within 5 minutes, so don&#x27;t rush to write the code. Even if a problem looks easy, I recommend that you follow the following order to solve it for two reasons 1) If you write the code before verifying the idea, you may find that the problem is not that simple or there is a boundary case that you ignore during the solution process, and then there is not enough time to push back and start over. 2) Even if your answer is correct, but the interviewer does not understand your solution, you may feel that you have done the question or lack of communication.</p><p>Ask questions
Test cases
Thinking
elaboration
Pseudocode
Code
Checking
2.3 Communication and interaction</p><p>The interviewer must have done this question before the mock interview or the formal interview. Unless you are 100% sure, it is best to solve the problem based on the interviewer&#x27;s thoughts and hints. Your goal is to get the interviewer to understand and agree with your thinking and code, not just to get the right answer. Before you start writing the code, it is important to communicate with the interviewer and ask if the method is suitable and where it can be optimized.</p><ol start="3"><li>Practice makes perfect</li></ol><p>In the first few mock interviews, I didn&#x27;t solve the questions within the time limit, and the feedback I got was not good. It wasn&#x27;t until more than a dozen times that I slowly started to get a feel for it, partly because I was used to the pace, and partly because practice makes perfect.</p><p>The first interview feedback &amp;amp;amp;amp; the latest interview feedback
Summary
Go ahead and try it. I was nervous at the beginning and my palms were sweating, but now I&#x27;m better. I benefited a lot from the mental strength, stress tolerance and communication skills I developed during the mock interview.</p><p>Translated with <a href="http://www.DeepL.com/Translator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/Interview-Science/Book/edit/main/docs/Algorithms guide/Mock Interview.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_3DPF"></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/Algorithms guide/Jump out"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Jump out</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Contents</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Interview Science, Inc.
