# Determine Your Job Intention

## Different types of engineers
There're several common positions in FANNG:
- Frontend Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- Software Reliability Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Data Science

If you aren't sure which dirrection is right for you, here are a few ways to learn more about these positions: 

### Consult With Your Friends
if you have engineer friends, they can give you more pertinent advice as they know more about your interests and talents;

### Looking up Expertise
By referring to related books and job description, you can better understand the job requirement and duties;

### Participate in Primary Course
We selected some courses for people who have zero experience:

- [Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)
- [Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)
- [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359)
- [AI Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-fundamentals--ud099)
- [Software Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258)

:::note
For those who intend to work at Data analyse or Machine learning position, you have to notice that there are fewer positons in this regard, which may lead to higher requirements.

## Job Qualification

If you have experience in playing maze game, you may find that it is more efficient to find a solution by starting from the exit, nor vice versa, same as the application. It's necessary for you be aware of the comany's requirement in advance, so that you can make targeted preparation. 

### Requirements in Different Regions
Are you eligible for full-time work authorization in that country? Will the company support you for your work visa(e.g., H-1B visa status, etc.)? This one is significant for your post selection. Most of the companies (like FANNG) we discussed headquarter in the USA, but they will also recruit in other areas, you can also apply in other regions given your situation.  

### Skills Requirement
Generally speaking, internships and new grad positions have higher standard for resume than social recruitment. You should start working on projects as job description and learn new programming languages. We'll discuss how to write perfect resume in the following sections. 

### Interview Content
If you compare engieers to football players, some of the biggest companies would enterview like 12 yards. Due to time limit, they can't get you to play the whole game so they only let you kick 12 yards to see if you're a good player. Under such circumstances, even a good player need to practise 12 yards. In programmer interviews, 12 yards corresponds to algorithm and system design. Even if some posts and companies may ask you some general questions and OOD, you should still mainly focus on algorithm and system design. 


### Wrong Example
A friend spent a year studying the hottest machine learning and six months for cryptography before interviewing for a job as a software engineer at Google. In this case he made two mistakes: 
1) There is no need to learn machine learning unless he is applying for such positon. Meanwhilem, the resume requirement of machine learning is relatively high, and education background and the number of papers are important assessment factors. Therefore, self-study alone couldn't get him a chance for interview. Besides, he didn't have enough certificates or Kaggle competitions experience to prove his ability;  
2) He mistook that the Google interviewer would be able to assess his abilities in all aspects, including the details of cryptography, in a 45-minute interview. But this is wrong, unless he is applying for a password post, otherwise no interviewer will understand the content he reviewed, not to mention interviewers never ask questions they're not familiar with. 

### Conclusion
Before reading the other sections, you should confirm your job intention.
