# Prepare a resume

The importance of a resume is obvious. Resumes serve two main purposes: first, to get an interview, and second, to guide the interviewer during the interview to ask you about the items and content on your resume. We share here some of the main points to note.

### Don't make common mistakes
- Do not use PDF format
- Misspelled words
- Resume is too long and not focused

### Github
If you don't have a Github account, I suggest you sign up for one. It's a great way to show that you really love open source projects and programming, and even if you don't have a great school or company background, a good Github page can be a great addition to your resume.
### Collage account

A well-maintained LinkedIn account is a definite plus, and in most cases, you should use it and match the content to your resume. This will give your resume more credibility and personal expertise.
