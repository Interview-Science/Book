## Why you need this guide

There are many scattered job searching information on the Internet, but the quality is uneven, which requires a lot of effort and time to find the one you need. This e-book was editted and reviewed by several FANNG(Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Nifty and Google) senior engineers and HR, including current and former employees.
