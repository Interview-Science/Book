# Application and Pattern

## NewsFeed

### Cache-Aside pattern
Improve performance by caching frequently accessed news feed data.

### Tools
- Redis
- Memcached
- Amazon ElastiCache
- Google Cloud Memorystore

### Interview Questions
Q: How do you determine which data to cache?

A: Use a variety of metrics to determine which data to cache, such as the popularity of the data, the frequency of access, and the size of the data.

Q: How do you handle cache invalidation when the data changes?

A: Use a cache invalidation mechanism to remove stale data from the cache.

Q: How do you ensure that the cached data is consistent with the data in the database?

A: Use a write-through cache or a cache coherency mechanism to ensure data consistency.

### Rate Limiting pattern
Prevent news feed system from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

### Tools
Nginx
Apache Traffic Server
Amazon API Gateway
Google Cloud Rate Limit Service

### Interview Questions
Q: How do you determine the appropriate rate limit?
A: Use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate rate limit, such as the number of requests per second, the number of requests per user, and the size of the requests.
Q: How do you handle requests that exceed the rate limit?
A: Use a variety of techniques to handle requests that exceed the rate limit, such as dropping the requests, queuing the requests, or returning an error message.
Q: How do you ensure that the rate limiter is fair and does not discriminate against certain users or clients?
A: Use a fair rate limiting algorithm, such as token bucket or leaky bucket, to ensure fairness.


### CQRS pattern
Separate read and write operations in news feed system.

### Tools
Event Store
Apache Kafka
Amazon Kinesis
Google Cloud Pub/Sub

### Interview Questions
Q: How do you ensure that the data in the read and write databases is consistent?
A: Use a variety of techniques to ensure data consistency, such as eventual consistency, snapshot isolation, or multi-version concurrency control.
Q: How do you handle queries that require data from both the read and write databases?
A: Use a query router to route queries to the appropriate database.
Q: How do you scale the CQRS pattern?
A: Use a distributed database or a CDN to scale the CQRS pattern.

### Sharding pattern
Horizontally partition news feed data to improve scalability.

### Tools
PostgreSQL
MySQL
Amazon Aurora
Google Cloud Spanner

### Interview Questions
Q: How do you determine how to shard the data?
A: Use a variety of factors to determine how to shard the data, such as the size of the data, the access patterns, and the desired level of scalability.
Q: How do you handle data that is too large to fit on a single shard?
A: Use a variety of techniques to handle large data, such as range partitioning, composite keys, or denormalization.
Q: How do you ensure that the data is evenly distributed across the shards?
A: Use a variety of techniques to ensure even data distribution, such as consistent hashing or round-robin sharding.
