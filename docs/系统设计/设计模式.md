# 设计模式

本文精选了 [Azure Cloud Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/) 中常用以及与面试相关的模式，重新进行分类以及列出关键点：

### [Ambassador pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/ambassador)

### [Asynchronous Request-Reply Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply)

### [Cache-Aside pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cache-aside)

使用缓存组件对数据进行分级存储，提高读取速度

[Issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cache-aside#issues-and-considerations)

Lifetime of cached data
> Don't make the expiration period too short because this can cause applications to continually retrieve data from the data store and add it to the cache. Similarly, don't make the expiration period so long that the cached data is likely to become stale. 

Evicting data
> Most caches adopt a least-recently-used policy for selecting items to evict, but this might be customizable.

Priming the cache
> Many solutions prepopulate the cache with the data that an application is likely to need as part of the startup processing.

Consistency
> Implementing the Cache-Aside pattern doesn't guarantee consistency between the data store and the cache.

Local (in-memory) caching
> This data could quickly become inconsistent between caches, so it might be necessary to expire data held in a private cache and refresh it more frequently. In these scenarios, consider investigating the use of a shared or a distributed caching mechanism.


**如何执行**
    
读取数据：
1. 检查缓存是否有数据，有的话从缓存返回
2. 如果没有的话，从持久化存储中读取数据
3. 将数据写入缓存

写数据：
1. 将数据写入持久化存储
2. 从缓存删除数据

[Circuit Breaker Issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)

Fail fast
> For some noncritical operations, it's better to fail fast rather than retry several times and impact the throughput of the application.

Exception Handling
> A request to a service can fail for a variety of reasons raising different exceptions depending on the nature of the failure. Some exceptions indicate a failure that can be resolved quickly, while others indicate that the failure is longer lasting. It's useful for the retry policy to adjust the time between retry attempts based on the type of the exception.

Idempotent
> retries could cause the operation to be executed more than once, with unintended side effects

Logging
> It's important to log all connectivity failures that cause a retry so that underlying problems with the application, services, or resources can be identified.

**需要关注**

[Issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction#issues-and-considerations)

Order
> The order of the steps in the compensating transaction doesn't necessarily have to be the exact opposite of the steps in the original operation. For example, one data store might be more sensitive to inconsistencies than another, and so the steps in the compensating transaction that undo the changes to this store should occur first.

Fail 
> A compensating transaction is also an eventually consistent operation and it could also fail. The system should be able to resume the compensating transaction at the point of failure and continue. It might be necessary to repeat a step that's failed, so the steps in a compensating transaction should be defined as idempotent commands. 

Retry logic
> Only stop the operation and initiate a compensating transaction if a step fails repeatedly or cannot be recovered.

[Issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/index-table#issues-and-considerations)

Create index tables when they're likely to be used regularly
> The overhead of maintaining secondary indexes can be significant. You must analyze and understand the queries that your application uses. Only create index tables when they're likely to be used regularly. Don't create speculative index tables to support queries that an application doesn't perform, or performs only occasionally.

Consistency
> If a system incorporates a number of index tables over very large data sets, it can be difficult to maintain consistency between index tables and the original data.

Partitioned or Sharded
> Index tables might themselves be partitioned or sharded.

[Issues and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/rate-limiting-pattern#issues-and-considerations)

Durable messaging system
> In scenarios where your APIs can handle requests faster than any throttled ingestion services allow, you'll need to manage how quickly you can use the service. However, only treating the throttling as a data rate mismatch problem, and simply buffering your ingestion requests until the throttled service can catch up, is risky. If your application crashes in this scenario, you risk losing any of this buffered data.

Improve throughput
> While not required, it's often recommended to send smaller amounts of records more frequently to improve throughput. So rather than trying to batch things up for a release once a second or once a minute, you can be more granular than that to keep your resource consumption (memory, CPU, network, etc.) flowing at a more even rate, preventing potential bottlenecks due to sudden bursts of requests. For example, if a service allows 100 operations per second, the implementation of a rate limiter may even out requests by releasing 20 operations every 200 milliseconds, as shown in the following graph.

Errors handle
> While the rate limiting pattern can reduce the number of throttling errors, your application will still need to properly handle any throttling errors that may occur.

Integrate multiple workstreams into rate limiting strategy
> If your application has multiple workstreams that access the same throttled service, you'll need to integrate all of them into your rate limiting strategy. For instance, you might support bulk loading records into a database but also querying for records in that same database. You can manage capacity by ensuring all workstreams are gated through the same rate limiting mechanism. Alternatively, you might reserve separate pools of capacity for each workstream.
